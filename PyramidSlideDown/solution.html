        <h2>Pyramid Slide Down from Codewars site (See console)</h2>

        <p>Pyramids are amazing! Both in architectural and mathematical sense.
            If you have a computer, you can mess with pyramids even if you are
            not in Egypt at the time. For example, let's consider the
            following problem. Imagine that you have a plane pyramid built of
            numbers, like this one here:<p>

            <p>/3/<br />
            \7\ 4 <br />
            2 \4\ 6 <br />
            8 5 \9\ 3<br />
            Here comes the task...</p>

            <p>Let's say that the 'slide down' is a sum of consecutive numbers
                from the top to the bottom of the pyramid. As you can see, the
                longest 'slide down' is 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23</p>

            <p>Your task is to write a function longestSlideDown (in ruby:
                longest_slide_down) that takes a pyramid representation as
                argument and returns its' longest 'slide down'. For example,</p>

            <p>By the way...</p>

            <p>My tests include some extraordinarily high pyramides so as you
                can guess, brute-force method is a bad idea unless you have a
                few centuries to waste. You must come up with something more
                clever than that.</p>

            <p>(c) This task is a lyrical version of the Problem 18 and/or Problem 67 on ProjectEuler.</p>
