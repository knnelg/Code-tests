Write a function that calculates the price of your car parking.

Input is two parameters (strings), E and L (Entering time and Leaving time). Fixed format of 'HH:MM'

The car park has an entry fee of £2.

The first hour is £3.

Any additional hours (or part hours) are £4 each.

So '09:43,10:43' would return 5 (£2 charge, and £3 for one hour).


'10:30,12:45' would return 13 (£2 charge, plus £3 for first hour plus 2*4 for the next hours/part-hours).

You can assume entry and leave times are in the same day, and leave time is after entry time.

Return cost of staying at car park.
